				This is to do with Mdern Web - Web revolutin

		1. When was the first time you used internet ? Year - Global average is 2007
		2. Where did you use internet ? -(Home/Office/Cyber/School) - Cyber 
		3. Why did u used internet for - email, check universit result, online games
		4. What was the source of internet (telephone / lan / Wifi-rare) - telephne
		5. What was the device - desktop - Laptop 
		
		Web developers created an application an web contents accordingly


		Today, things are differnt
		2. Mobile phones / tables (differnt sizes, width, height, resolution etc...)
		3. This bring a change in habbit 
			Video
			Image
			Camera, web check in, navigator etc
			Hardware - cache 
			when  was the last you cleared browser cache
		4. Mobile data is the source - which is nt static and people want to use it everywhere
		5. Reduce the round trips between client and server


=-==================================================================
		and thus the idea of client centeric develpment came it
			here on web - Only 3 languages are understood 
					HTML - HTML5 (super awsome)
					CSS - CSS3 (super super awsome, totally removed dependency on vendor specific tools)
					JS - this was a major challange (JS was not OOPS based)
						Thus they brough ECMA Script (which is OOPS based)		
							this is again difficult to learn 
						Microsoft - took the language standars - gave compilers and a new language
					Gave us TypeScript

			AngularJS (MVC pattern) - really helpful fr small applications
			Angular by google - they use (HTML+CSS+JS) to render a plugin on the brwsers - cmponent - it will go to serverr only refresh the data 
			React by facebook 

	
	 component - it will go to serverr only refresh the data - making a Rest call

		Class file, which will include HTML and JS, and gets rendered as 1 unit
