		Post Lunch : Diagrams and Solid Principles

		UML - Unified Modelling language (this is all about visuals)

				for OOPS (Class Diagram)
				for DB   (ER Diagram)
				for network (Network diagram)

			this is all about shapes and them communication

		Diagrams have levels
			1.0
			1.1 (more details)
			1.2 (more in detail)
			1.3 (more in details)


			For a same class, object of this class will be created and managed in different ways
			memory management will be differnt
			lifecycle will be diffeent

		class diagram does not include data, where as object diagram has a data













			SDLC
			OOPS with UML
			OOPS with Solid Principles
			OPPS with DP



			SOLID Principles are 5  principles
			S - keep only the related operations in a class, 
				non related move to other class
			Accounts:
			widraw()
			deposit()
			transfer()
