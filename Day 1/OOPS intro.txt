				Object Oriented Programming

	Object - A Real World Entity, which is programmed by a developer and further used for automation, 		 reporting, analysis

	Oriented - A technique to create the objects

		C Programming - Dannie ritchi
		OOPS          - Smalltalk - Alan Kay along with Xerox Research Group
		C++           - Barne stratpous
			added OOPS to C and gave compilers and keywords

	-------------------------------------------------------------------
		OOPS - Class -
			 Develope a blueprint of an object
			and we have 4 pillars to design the object

		 Abstraction : Consider only properties and function(and other enums,constructors etc)
			which are in scope of an software
				Eg.To open a new bank account (50+ properties)
				
				Blood group ?
				No of siblings ? May not be imp (data type to be int)+ field in database

				sleepingHabits(), eatingHabbits()
		
				How about Hospital Software?
				Blood group ?
				No of siblings ? (data type to be int)
				sleepingHabits(), eatingHabbits()

			we mark the class as abstract, mostly this classes are parent class, top of the module


		Encapsulation : Create software easy to very easy to use
				but
				Difficult to understand on how it work
			achive it using properties and fucntions

		Inheritance : Reuse the code as much as possible
			achive it using (:) in C#, extends in Java simpilar other ways in other languages

		Polymorphism : Same signature, different behavious
			mark a method as virtual in parent class
			make a methof as overrides in child class
		

		---
		once comfortable in OOPS implementation
		we have solid principles

		and then Design pattern for more better apps
